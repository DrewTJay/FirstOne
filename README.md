# FirstOne – My Digital Playground
Welcome to my world!☁️<br />
This is a growing collection of my projects – from HTML, CSS & JavaScript web experiments to<br />
Python scripts and most importantly, 3D models in Blender and Open-World Mobile Games in Unity.

What’s this about?
I document everything that drives me and what I aim to build in the future. Large 3D worlds, <br />
polished characters, and high-end technical game design are the focus here. In business life I am an IT-Admin <br />
and official AI/ML Engineer, based in Berlin Germany. While this right here is my creative lab, <br />
my toolbox, and maybe the first step toward something big.

***What’s Inside?***<br />
**Unity** – I develop 3D Open-World Mobile Games for fun<br />
**Blender** – Improving my skills in 2D to 3D texture mapping, UV shading and beyond<br />
**WebGL & three.js** – Including JavaScript, and AI to boost results<br />
...
<br />
I’m open to new ideas, honest feedback, and professional exchange. <br />
