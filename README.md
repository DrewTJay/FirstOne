# FirstOne – My Digital Playground
Welcome to my world!☁️<br />
This is a growing collection of my projects – from HTML, CSS & JavaScript web experiments<br />
to Python scripts and most importantly, 3D models in Blender and Open-World Mobile Games in Unity.

What’s this about?
I document everything that drives me and what I aim to build in the future. Large 3D worlds, polished characters, and high-end technical game design are the focus here. This is my creative lab, my toolbox, and maybe the first step toward something big.

What’s inside?
Unity – I develop Open-World Mobile Games that are not just visually impressive but also technically optimized for smooth performance.
Blender – I create detailed 3D models, realistic textures, and animations. The goal is to design high-quality, modern assets for games, virtual worlds, and beyond.
Web & AI – I work with JavaScript, Python, and Machine Learning to develop interactive and dynamic applications.
